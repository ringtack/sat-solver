# SAT Solver

A CDCL-based SAT solver implemented in Rust, with watched literals, EVSIDS, Glucose-based clause deletion, conflict clause minimization, and Luby-based restarts. Based heavily on [MiniSat](http://minisat.se/).

Implemented for project 1 (Vehicle Customization) in [CSCI2951O: Prescriptive Analytics](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2951-o/index.html). 

For implementation details, optimizations, and experimental results, see the [detailed report](./report.pdf).
